// Configuring PhysBAM on Ubuntu or OSX
//
//#####################################################################

1. Get a package manager. If you are running Ubuntu, you have apt-get. If you are running Mac OSX, install macports or homebrew.

2. Install git and emacs (you probably have already installed git if you are reading this)

Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install emacs23

Mac:
sudo port install git
sudo port install emacs

3. Clone PhysBAM. As of Jan 2014, it's stored on hydra. Use

   git clone hydra.math.ucla.edu:/git/PhysBAM ./


4. cd to the root PhysBAM directory and copy SConstruct.options into this directory

   cp Scripts/scons/SConstruct.options ./


5. Install g++/gcc and upgrade to a newer version (As of January 2014, version 4.8.2 is required. If you are
   running Mac OSX, 4.8.2 is available via Macports. If you are running Ubuntu, and are not already at 4.8.2 
   or above, you will need to install it manually. Here are some instructions to do that, but beware they may
   be incomplete.)

	5a. Install g++:

	   sudo apt-get install g++

	5b. Go to Ubuntu Software Center and install all extra versions of g++ needed.
	5c. Go to folder /usr/bin and give the commands (to upgrade to version 4.8.2):

	   ls -l g*
	   sudo rm g++ gcc
	   sudo ln -s g++-4.5 g++
	   sudo ln -s gcc-4.5 gcc
	   sudo rm x86_64-linux-gnu-g++ x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
	   sudo ln -s g++-4.5 x86_64-linux-gnu-g++
	   sudo ln -s gcc-4.5 x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc


6. Install various packages required for PhysBAM to compile and run.

   scons, boost, petsc, bison, flex -- libraries necessary for various compiling tasks
   libpng, lipjpeg, libavformat, libavcodec, libavutil -- for processing, creating various A/V formats

   Newer versions for these libraries may have been added since this was written. It's worth double-checking.
   In Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install scons
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
   sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
   sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev
   sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev
   sudo apt-get install libavutil-dev
   sudo apt-get install petsc-dev
   sudo apt-get install libglut3-dev (freeglut3-dev)
   sudo apt-get install bison
   sudo apt-get install flex

   For Mac, some of these packages are found by installing XCode Developer Tools, and most of the A/V ones are included in ffmpeg.


7. Configure your SConstruct.options file (in your PhysBAM directory), your .bashrc file (in your home directory), and your .emacs
   file (in your home directory). The SConstruct.options file is used when PhysBAM compiles, the .bashrc file contains useful
   Terminal commands, and the .emacs file contains commands and scripts for Emacs (useful for coding in PhysBAM, your life is much
   easier if you get this working properly.)

   It may be easiest to steal/borrow someone else's versions of these until you figure out how to configure things on your own.
   Ask permission first.


8. The command to compile PhysBAM is:

   nice scons --warn=no-duplicate-environment --warn=no-deprecated -Q --implicit-cache -k -u TYPE=release -j 4

   most people have an alias for this ('cs') in their .bashrc file.


9. If you've done all this and you still can't successfully compile/run PhysBAM, ask someone else for help. Find out what you needed
   that wasn't included in this file, and add it to the file :-)

The PhysBAM OpenGL framework defines a number of default controls
for visualizations based on OPENGL_WORLD. These are:

left drag:               rotate around target
right drag:              zoom in and out (vertical motion only)
control and left drag:   move target in vertical plane
control and right drag:  move target in horizontal plane

control-q:  quit
control-s:  toggle between regular and red-blue stereo rendering
control-w:  cycle between regular, wireframe, and shaded wireframe rendering
control-f:  toggle between regular and full-screen viewing
control-v:  show visible target temporarily
control-d:  dump screenshot to disk (the console window will prompt you for a filename)
control-m:  move camera in towards target
control-n:  move camera out from target
control-y:  move camera horizontally around target (to the left)
control-u:  move camera horizontally around target (to the right)
control-i:  move target forward horizontally
control-o:  move target backward horizontally
control-j:  move target down
control-k:  move target up
control-h:  move target left horizontally
control-l:  move target right horizontally
control-r:  show frames per second (rendering speed)
control-g:  toggle smooth shading for objects that think they have a choice
control-a:  display object names

It is recommended that applications using the framework avoid binding control key
combinations, and instead use regular letters for their application-specific features.

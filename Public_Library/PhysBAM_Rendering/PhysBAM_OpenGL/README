This Repository contains the opengl used by PhysBAM.  It can (and should) depend on PhysBAM_Tools and PhysBAM_Geometry.

From Ron:
  The point is that these (PhysBAM_Rendering and PhysBAM_OpenGL) are only here to visualize the geometry - and any algorithms such as Intersections or Tessellation should be moved into
  PhysBAM_Geometry.

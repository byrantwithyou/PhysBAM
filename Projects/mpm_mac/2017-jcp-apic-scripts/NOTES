Artifacts in dam break 2D simulation sequences
* A "cavity" is caused by a single particle when constant density is used.
  With constant density, a particle would occupy 3x3(order=2) volumes.
  Use "-use_mass" would alleviate this problem but introduce boiling/vorticity.
  Note that should treat very small mass as 0 when "-use_mass".
  In the paper, we planed to use this simulation to illustrate the reason
  of this artifact. Also we wanted to show this method conserves angular
  momentum and talk about why we do not use this in the dam break test
  (because we want to measure the true vorticity).
* Incorrect vorticity in PIC. When fluid climb to the right wall,
  there is a noticeable ccw vorticity on the concave surface.
  The reason is unknown.
  But I suspect that this is because we did not do extrapolation for free surface.
  Thus the outer layer moves much slower than the layer ones,
  which leads to shear.

Issues in dam break 3D
FLIP seems get much larger volume in the simulation.
This needs to be reconfirmed.

To check:

* Periodic poisson disk

* BC option for slip vs stick, implement for viscosity

* Do a better BC treatment for viscosity.  Compute BC directly from raw information rather than from pressure information.

* Optional Fourier decomposition of velocity field at end of frame

* Optional generation of stats from decomposed velocity field
  - Total KE
  - histogram of KE by magnitude of k
  - KE by eigenvalue (heat image)

Broken:

* selecting grid cell in slice mode in 3d, nothing gets printed

* grid does not print out velocities when selected in 2d

* cannot select anything o-be3-08

To be implemented:

* Collisions with friction

* Threading

* Dump out meshes for forces in a way that allows viewer to see them.

* Make viewer aware of MPM_PARTICLES directly

* Implement an example with both mesh-based and non-mesh-based forces


To be debugged:

* Get rotation test working


To test:

* Make sure -flip works correctly

* Make sure -order 1 and -order 3 both work correctly

* Test -particles_per_cell

* Test -restart

To do:

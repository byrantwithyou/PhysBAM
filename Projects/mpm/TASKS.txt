To be implemented:

* Collisions with friction

* Threading

* Invalid particles
  - Invalidate particles that leave domain
  - Update simulated_particles properly

* Dump out meshes for forces in a way that allows viewer to see them.

* Make viewer aware of MPM_PARTICLES directly

* Implement an example with both mesh-based and non-mesh-based forces



To be debugged:

* use_midpoint

* Does not conserve linear momentum:
  - ./mpm 2 -resolution 30 -max_dt .002 -last_frame 200 -scale_mass 1 -scale_E 1 -affine -solver_tolerance .5


To test:

* Make sure -flip works correctly

* Make sure -order 1 and -order 3 both work correctly

* Test -particles_per_cell

* Test -restart

To do:

* Set more sensible defaults for:
  - -newton_iterations
  - -newton_tolerance
  - -solver_iterations
  - -solver_tolerance

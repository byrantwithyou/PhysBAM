To be implemented:

* Collisions with friction

* Threading

* Dump out meshes for forces in a way that allows viewer to see them.

* Make viewer aware of MPM_PARTICLES directly

* Implement an example with both mesh-based and non-mesh-based forces


To be debugged:

* Get rotation test working

* Newton does not converge for test 8, when collisions are occuring.


To test:

* Make sure -flip works correctly

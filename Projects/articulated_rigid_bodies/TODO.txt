Things To Do
------------------
- add ability to specify a contact graph
- remove collisions with neighboring joints

Default constraints.
It makes sense for it to be unconstrained (i.e., false for constrained), 
and then a point joint is fully constrained prismatically but not 
otherwise. But a point joint is also the most common behavior, but now we 
have a bool so it's easier.

-- make most general joint to be free in all 6 dof

- set prismatic component to be contraint in rigid/twist/etc, i.e., things that don't need component. only the general joint will use the component

- have set Joint_frame do everything it needs to through virtual functions

- GENERAL_JOINT_3D and TWIST_JOINT_3D Set_Joint_Frame() do different things with regards to prismatic
    - the former calls Prismatic_Component_Translation() and the latter calls Constrain_Prismatically on J.t...

------------------------
1. Start creating some specific joint types and thinking about what makes sense both in them and more importantly for JOINT_3D

POINT_JOINT_3D

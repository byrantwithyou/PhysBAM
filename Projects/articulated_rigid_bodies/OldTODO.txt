A. kinematics - done except for quaternion interpolation
   - given rigid body and joint positions -> draw 
     (resolve inconsistencies along the way)
   - pick an ordering and live with it
     ("shock propogation" idea)
     1. single parent -> easy DONE 
     2. multiple parents  ((1))  DONE
	breadth-better quaternion interpolation -- DONE
   - partial update - from a starting point down the tree
     1. if you change a joint, take the child and update him 
        (including effects of multiple parents - i.e., reaverage)
        and then following levels go down the tree -> DONE
     2. if you change a rigid body, change all parent joints as well, 
        then take the child and do #1, change all parent joints -- DONE
	J = (F_wj)^-1*F_wc*(F_jc)^-1
	J = F_jw*F_wc*F_cj
   - TODO: make an example where the linear interpolation of quaternions performs poorly, ask Leo

B. dynamics 
   - update rigid bodies (gravity, contact, collision)
   - update joints (impulses(2)  & shock propogation(1) to enforce constraints)
	dt=j_hat(1/m1 + 1/m2)
	j_hat=dt/(1/m1+1/m2)

	look for enforcement of angular joint constraints


     might rexcite collision & contact (3)
     1. shock propogation - DONE . . . minus partial update change
        - gets as much of an ordering as possible (i.e., multiple parents)
        - resolves order
     2. do impulses to enforce constraints
     3. update rigid bodies with gravity, contact, & collision

C. inverse kinematics
   - Honda stuff
   - provide external forces (?) to force rigid bodies into some configuration
     (target mocap)
   - deal with results - by doing dynamics update rigid bodies?

D. Inverse Dynamics

E. Inverse Activations
   - meet up with Igor and Eftychios

NOTES:
-------------
     The translation is noise. Humans don't work to optimize translation--they work to do the correct rotation to achieve the desired motion. The translation is a noisy result which must then be corrected for. Therefore, we only need the rotation and the translation will come about from the prismatic component per usual.
